*💡 Core Concept*

<!-- * *FPS survival game.* -->
<!-- * *3 lives (or configurable).* -->
* *AI enemies keep coming and shooting.*
<!-- * *After each death → respawn at a different point.* -->
<!-- * *there will be multiple waves (like 3~4) which player has to survive and after the player kills each enemy of the last wave, player wins* -->
<!-- * *now there are two choises: whether waves will come after a certain time or as soon as the last wave ends* -->
<!-- * *Game over if lives = 0* -->



*🔫 Special Feature*

<!-- * *Toggle shooting type (projectile vs. raycast) via dev menu, making it flexible and modular for future projects.* -->
* *when projectile, give a feature of auto aim, but this auto aim is like when fired, the bullet will auto correct its direction while in the air like a homing missile to aim the enemy nearest to the target point when fired...*
